# IT-JobMarket-Analysis
This repo was used for the completion of my IBM: Data Analyst Capstone Project where I was to play the role of a data analyst in an international IT firm. In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, I was tasked with analyzing job market data to help identify future skill requirements.

An old dataset (2019) was used for this project.

The result of this project can be helpful for everyone part of the IT space.
